Day 31 Capstone - Flash Card Project


Finally got around to doing it, but day 31 Capstone Project for Udemy's 100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp.

It's built using tkinter to handle the GUI and functions to handle flipping the cards and initializing a new word. I used the pandas library to handle the conversion of csv's.

When the checkmark is entered, the word is removed from the word bank. When the export list button is hit, if it doesn't exist, a new document will be created and that will be the word bank moving forward.
It's currently set up for French, but minor tweaking and a new word bank and its modular to other topics
